<h1>All About Sourdough Bread</h1>

<p>
  Sourdough bread is a type of bread made with natural yeast and bacteria through fermentation.
  This process gives the bread its unique flavor, chewy texture, and slightly tangy taste.
  Sourdough has a crunchy crust and soft, airy interior, making it a favorite among bread lovers.
  It is often easier to digest than regular bread and usually does not contain artificial additives.
  Making sourdough at home requires patience and attention, as the dough needs time to rise slowly
  and develop its rich flavor. Many people enjoy the process of feeding the starter, kneading the
  dough, and watching the bread grow. The aroma of freshly baked sourdough is truly irresistible,
  and it pairs perfectly with butter, jam, or cheese. Sourdough bread has a long history and
  is considered one of the healthiest types of bread available today.
